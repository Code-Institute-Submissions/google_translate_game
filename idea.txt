            }

Extra thoughts: -------------

-random number generator
way to "pop" out words from list
-run number generator again .... until game list is filled

-----------------------------

--have two lists
link both words though a same class then change to display none

--multiple levels of difficulty
    one with disappearing blocks that rows collapse
    one with block that stay in the same place
    one with blocks that cause the row to reshape
    


    timer to complete the level

    put in own words or have auto fill
