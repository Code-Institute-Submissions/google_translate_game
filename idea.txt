                        basic frame

            css{
                        basic styling
                        Framework -bootstrap
            }

            Javascript{
                        flip cards
                        auto fill cards with imported text from a text file
                        load apis

Class requirments:------- 
            api{
                google translate-------to translate english into another language, 
                (5 total languages to start)
                (https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages)
            }
            
            api{
                google or alexa--------- to speak foreign and/or english words as they are paired
                (https://developers.google.com/assistant/surfaces/speakers)**possible start**
            }

Extra thoughts: -------------

-random number generator
way to "pop" out words from list
-run number generator again .... until game list is filled

-----------------------------

--have two lists
link both words though a same class then change to display none

--multiple levels of difficulty
    one with disappearing blocks that rows collapse
    one with block that stay in the same place
    one with blocks that cause the row to reshape
    


    timer to complete the level

    put in own words or have auto fill


--------------------------------romancing the cards ----- all the romance languages---------------------------
----------start modal------------
name
game mode        champaign, quick, custom
difficulty      --champaign (easy, medium, hard)
card numbers    --cards on screen
language       --languages offered
timer       --timer set

Understanding Event Delegation


-----------------------
27th ----
make matched cards unclickable
push entire deck down to make room for player point count and timer
tweak transition times to make cards flow better and jerk less
add a card shadow to cards when "picked up"
 ---- extra idea make cards appear at bottom of screen when choosen to help force a delay timer
 increase size of words
 add border to flipped over cards when word is showing

how complicated should fuctions be? 
Is a function worth naming for 1 - 3 lines of code within?
is there a to complicated function?
is there a cleaner way of using .append for adding divs, etc...
    -should I use literal "`" marks instead of """ marks
Is having a start file a common idea? (card.js)
Global variables vs local variables
    -if a global variable is called in local setting with var does teh function create a "local" version


Structure of a js file should be?
    -------mine ex--------
    -variables at top
    -named functions following
    -a "start file" consisting of the initial function and essential must load variables

--  pair an language with english counter part
-- pair two of same language


object key value pair

(Not needed for testing)***
-where can I find argument/call descriptions for jasmine?***
-is there a place I can view a better description of jasmine and its use?***

var html = `

addEventListener  \\click, keyup, keydown //--look in MDN

Current bugs ------------
w3c css says linear gradient has --- "Value Error : background-image is an incorrect operator )"
is there an easy way of seeing rem value outside of using different interfaces, ex phone
is there a value of anything that will shrink text instead of allowing it to move to a different line AND stay in the same box, div, etc....
